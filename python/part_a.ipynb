    "This tutorial, as most of the course, is written in Jupyter Notebooks (formerly iPython Notebooks).  These notebooks are run through your browser, and contain individual blocks.  If you run code in a block, the notebook will remember what has been run (until you shut down or restart), meaning any subsequent blocks will retain values, function definitions, etc., from previously run blocks.  They're also handy for instruction, as we can write text (like this!).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running code, the block will show you a number in brackets on the left side, to tell you the number in the sequence that block had been run.  If the code you run has an output, the output will be displayed below the block.  You can run an individual block by selecting it, and pressing CTRL-ENTER.  To run the block, and then place the selection on the block below, press SHIFT-ENTER.  To create a new block below the currently selected block, press B.\n",

    "## Writing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at any Python, there are some key terms that need to be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the set of rules and symbols used to correctly structure a program for a specific language. In the English language this is referred to as grammar. Essentially, it's making sure that periods, commas, words, etc., are all in the right place so that a computer can understand what you are trying to tell it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is any combination of symbols that represent a value. We will see this more when covering variables and types. An expression would be something like \"3 < 5\".  In code, what this \"expresses\" is \"3 is less than 5\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is the smallest standalone element of a language that \"says something\". Common examples you will see include If-Then statments, as well as For and While loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Many words that have a definition in english that you are used to may have a completely different meaning in computer programming. The three words above are examples of that. If at any point something doesn't make sense try google that word with the word \"computer science\" following it, like \"expression computer science\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a developer takes on a large project, they are often working with a huge code base and with other developers. It is important to understand code when you come back to it or when other developers need to use it. One way we can achieve this is through comments.  In Python, single lines are commented by placing a # symbol at the beginning of the comment.  Python will ignore everything on a line that follows a #, meaning you can place a comment after code that will be run.  Here are two examples:"

    "## Reading Code\n",
    "Writing code can be challenging enough, but the most confusing thing for those new to programming is predicting what code will do based on how it is written. When reading code for the first time, your best bet is to read it line by line, top to bottom to see what actions will be taken, and what references are made. It's important to note that the code when executed by the computer may not perform actions in the exact sequence you see: the program may make references to previous sections of code (like with functions), it may have a number of options presented and only take one particular path depending on what values it has been given (like with if statements), or it may take single lines of code and repeat them many times (like with loops). We'll see many examples of these throughout this unit. \n",

    "### Values and Types\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python we group concepts like numbers, words, and decision making into a set of symbols the computer understands.  The computer needs to keep track of what kind of value an object is to be able to know what actions it can perform, as only certain actions will work with certain types. Here are three of the most common types we'll be seeing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Numeric**.  There are two main types of numeric values, **integer (int)** and **float**.  An integer is a whole number that is either positive or negative (e.g.: 5, 10, -2, 3245). A float is a number with decimals (e.g. 12.217, -3.2, 0.111). \n",
    "2. **String**. A string is a sequence of characters. They have no inherent value other than just literally the characters in the order they appear.  They are denoted by putting quotations marks around symbols; examples include \"a\", \"xyzwp\", \"Hello World!\", and even numbers when placed in the quotations like \"1\".  (To be clear, 12 is an integer, \"12\" is a string.)\n",
    "3. **Boolean**. Booleans are ```True``` or ```False``` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other types we will be seeing soon, such as lists, dictionaries, and dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric types are used for computation and storing numerical data (which we'll be seeing a lot of).  Strings are often used to keep track of information, like names.  Booleans are are predominantly used when evaluating conditionals - determining if a given statement is True or False; they are used to make smart code that helps with decision making, which we will see shortly."
