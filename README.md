# Welcome Message 

Congradulations and welcome to the 2024 cohort of the MFRE program at UBC. We are excited to have you join us and look forward to meeting you in person. As you know, the MFRE program is a unique program that combines economics, policy, and business with a focus on food and resource economics. We are confident that you will find the program both challenging and rewarding.

We look forward to meeting you in person and wish you all the best as you begin your studies at UBC. But before we do, this repository contains some important information that you should review before you arrive for the summer bootcamp in August.

As you know, the bootcamp will cover the basics of micro and macro to start and then move to the coding and data analysis component. This repository is designed to help you prepare for the bootcamp and to provide you with some resources that you can use to get up to speed on the basics.

Many of you come from different backgrounds and have different levels of experience with coding. This is why even though you are not expected to, we highly recommend that you enroll in [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) before you arrive. This is an online course that's basically Harvard's introduction to computer science which runs thorughout a typical semester and is updated every year. It's a great course and will give you a solid foundation in computer science and programming.

This welcome package is deisgned as a distilation of the most important concepts that is covered in CS50 with extensions for applications in data manipulation. It is not a replacement for the course but it will give you a good head start and cover the basics that you will need for the bootcamp.
